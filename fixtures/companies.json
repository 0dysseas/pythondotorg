ILM has won numerous Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects, not\r\nto mention a string of Clio awards for its work on television advertisements. While much of ILM's early work was done with miniature models and motion\r\ncontrolled cameras, ILM has long been on the bleeding edge of computer\r\ngenerated visual effects. Its computer graphics division dates back to 1979,\r\nand its first CG production was the 1982 Genesis sequence from Star Trek II:\r\nThe Wrath of Khan.",
