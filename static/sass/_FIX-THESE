TO DO: 
***

Blockquotes should not have a FOOTER element inside of them. Change markup and associated CSS

-999em or -9999em is too large. Use pixels in this case or the browser could use too much memory rendering the absurdly large distance. 

Drop down menus with right: -999em styles produce a horiz scroll bar in Chrome. 

Make the breakpoints in layout.scss work on variables. Easier to change in one place than in both the layout and mq files.
